Here's what happens when a browser loads a website:

Fetch the HTML page (e.g. index.html)
Begin parsing the HTML
The parser encounters a <script> tag referencing an external script file.
The browser requests the script file. Meanwhile, the parser blocks and stops parsing the other HTML on your page.
After some time the script is downloaded and subsequently executed.
The parser continues parsing the rest of the HTML document.

        <title>My Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="user-greeting">Welcome, user.</div>
        <!-- unless noted by the async attribute, scripts will load in the order they are declared in markup, demonstrated here.-->
        <script type="text/javascript">

            var gobie = " Here is the second script.";
            /* Here we reference a variable from the second script, already declared and initialized, modyifing its content*/
            goby = 90909;
        </script>
        <script type="text/javascript">
