                <p> An experiment in collaboration between technology and art, game jams are proven as an effective tool for learning, creating, and fostering communities united by game development and design. </p>
                <p> We want to make videogames and we would love it if you could join us.</p>
                <p> The challenge is simple: </p>
                <h3> 1. Make a Game</h3>
                <p><span>Anything goes. A platformer, a puzzle game, an rpg, a dungeon crawler, a text-based adventure. When we mean anything, we truly mean it.</span><p>
                <h3> 2. Make it Quick </h3>
                <p><span>Your 16-hour magnum opus will have to wait. We want you to make the game in seven days from ideation to gameplay, graphics and finishing touches.</span><p>
                <h3> 3. Make it before time runs out </h3>
                <p>No tardies.</p>

                <h1> Rules of Engagement </h1>
                <p> 1. This is a 7-day long event starting Wednesday, March 4th at 5.45 pm and ending at Wednesday, March 11th at 10.00 pm, which constitutes the deadline for all games to be submitted to the Jam.</p>
                <p> 2. At the start of the Jam, a theme for the Jam will be chosen at random. The games submitted to the Game Jam will have to address, include, or treat the theme in some manner.</p>
                <p> 3. Participants are encouraged, but not required, to start planning and developing the game after the official start of the Jam. They are, however, to learn the tools they will be using ahead of time.</p>
                <p> 4. Team efforts, as well as entries to the Game Jam from individuals, are accepted.</p>
                <p> 5. The games themselves should be as functional and complete as possible. Participants are allowed to deliver un­finished games, but will be penalized if they simply deliver concepts, artwork, or an unplayable game.</p>
                <p> 6. The games must run on a Windows or  GNU/Linux OS PC, either as stand­alone executables, browser games, or command­line text­based adventures. No mobile games are allowed due to platform limitations.</p>
                <p> 7. Any and all art­styles, genres, and mechanics are allowed as long as they are functional within the required platform.</p>
                <p> 8. The participants will submit the entry games to a GitHub or BitBucket public code repository, and shall include build instructions along with a stand­alone executable if they intend to work through that route. If the game is browser­-based, the player must provide a live version of their work at a publicly­available domain, whether hosted through Github Pages or another provider, in addition to their files in a public repository. </p>
                <p>9. In order to participate in the game jam, the developers must send an email to shacsgamejam@mail.com that includes the URL to their public repository and their live version if applicable.</p>
                <p>10. Derivative works from other videogames or other pieces of media are allowed as long as the game makers acknowledge in writing their original sources. You are allowed to use spritesheets, art, sounds, and mechanics lifted from other games. The game jam rejects any carbon copies of existing properties.</p>
                <p>11. Any subject is appropriate for submissions to the game jam, including explicit content. The game jam and it's organizers welcome a breadth and variety of perspectives, however it does not hold any responsiblity over the content of submissions.</p>

                <p>Perhaps the most popular free game engine out there, Unity is a complete development suite for artists and programmers alike for 2D and 3D. It also has the biggest learning curve, and a lot of tutorials are misleading. Powerful, but requires a level 15 Code Monkey to use. Use responsibly.

                <p>A game engine for the absolute beginner. No previous programming knowledge required. 2D only. The tutorials by YoYo Games are all you need to know what to do. It's quite limited in the range of things you can do with it. Don't think it's a mediocre tool: Hotline Miami is a GameMaker game.

                <p>An alternative to GameMaker, Construct2 allows you to make and deploy games easily to the web browser. It allows for a wider breadth of concepts and plays nicely with most browsers. It implements a rudimentary event system to substitute a programming language. Quality tutorials for C2 are scarce.</p>

                <p>Powerful and fast, Flixel is a Flash Game Engine that excels at retro 2D graphics. Tutorials abound, but to get the full experience you need to dissect Adam Atomic's code examples. Note: You need Adobe Flash to work with it, as well as someone who has worked with ActionScript 3. Otherwise, use FlashDevelop with Apache Flex.</p>

                <p>Photon Storm's response to Flixel, Phaser is a Game Engine that stands above all other Javascript game engines for it's simplicity and power for browser games. Scalable, extensible, and versatile. In addition to Javascript, you can use Microsoft's super-set of the language: Typescript.</p>

                <p>The Godot Game Engine is the little known Open Source response to the Unity Game Engine. It's still a bit rough around the edges, but if you learn how to use it, it packs quite a punch. It can do 3D as well as 2D game using a custom programming language. The only documentation worth reading is by the creators themselves.</p>

Inklewriter is a tool to create interactive, choose-your-own-adventure stories that used to be the bread and butter of games before pixels were invented.

A beefy beast that will require quite a bit of effort and patience to master, LibGDX is a veritable swiss-army knife of Game Engines that is able to deploy to multiple platforms, including mobile and web, with only one codebase. A monster worth taming.</p>

Unreal Engine is not free as-is, but if you register yourself with a .edu email address, UE4 and all of it's components are free for a year. This is the tool the professionals use.

            <h1>Tips and Advice</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="res col-md-4">
                <h2>When in doubt, 2D</h2>
                <p>Working in 3D adds an extra dimension of complexity in code, design and art. We encourage you to work in a 2D perspective, simply because it's easier and won't make you cry.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="res col-md-4">
                <h2>Don't Over-do It</h2>
                <p>We absolutely guarantee you will not be creating a Fallout 3 here. There is simply not enough time. Think of a small, easily understood experience that packs a punch, not a long, drawn-out, boring slog.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="res col-md-4">
                <h2>Think Doable</h2>
                <p>Always create a goal that you can achieve with your current skillset. It's great to be ambitious, but remember that we want a finished game. Not a half-baked, million-dollar idea.</p>
            </div>
             <div class="res col-md-4">
                <h2>If it works, go for it.</h2>
                <p>Often we obsess over the little details, whether it's in code or art. Here, quick and dirty does the job: Whether it's a massive switch statement or a walk cycle of 6 frames, go with what works at the time.  You are on a clock.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="res col-md-4">
                <h2>Don't fall in love.</h2>
                <p>If it doesn't work, it simply doesn't work. Don't be afraid to fail. There is no letter grade, no big prize, no penalty for failing. If something doesn't work, scrap it and move on.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="res col-md-4">
                <h2>Gameplay First</h2>
                <p>You might want to experiment with a fantastic story, engaging characters, or a beautiful art style. Unless you are writing a Visual Novel or a Text-Based Adventure, try out your game mechanic first. Once you are convinced that this is fun to play, you can flesh out the game.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="res col-md-4">
                <h2>Fun First</h2>
                <p>Is the game fun? Or otherwise engaging? If not, then why are you working on it?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="res col-md-4">
                <h2>Document yourself</h2>
                <p>Game Jams are not our idea, they are a popular practice in which hundreds of developers pitch in and create something. Check examples from Ludum Dare and see what you can learn from them. Read tutorials and watch videos on the tools you intend to use.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="res col-md-4">
                <h2>Do one thing well.</h2>
                <p>Games are as big and complex as the designers and developers can make them. Instead of doing many things badly, make sure your game does at least ONE thing well. This goes for game jam projects as well as AAA, mutli-million dollar projects. Maybe they should be asking us for advice.</p>
