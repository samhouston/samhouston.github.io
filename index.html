                <h2> The SHACS | Siggraph March Game Jam </h2>
                <p> An experiment in collaboration between technology and art, game jams are proven as an effective tool for learning, creating, and fostering communities united by game development and design. </p>
                <p> We want to make videogames and we would love it if you could join us.</p>
                <p> The challenge is simple: </p>
                <h3> 1. Make a Game</h3>
                <p><span>Anything goes. A platformer, a puzzle game, an rpg, a dungeon crawler, a text-based adventure. When we mean anything, we truly mean it.</span><p>
                <h3> 2. Make it Quick </h3>
                <p><span>Your 16-hour magnum opus will have to wait. We want you to make the game in seven days from ideation to gameplay, graphics and finishing touches.</span><p>
                <h3> 3. Make it before time runs out </h3>
                <p>No tardies.</p>

                <h2> Rules of Engagement </h2>
                <p> 1. This is a 7-day long event starting Wednesday, March 4th at 5.45 pm and ending at Wednesday, March 11th at 10.00 pm, which constitutes the deadline for all games to be submitted to the Jam.</p>
                <p> 2. At the start of the Jam, a theme for the Jam will be chosen at random. The games submitted to the Game Jam will have to address, include, or treat the theme in some manner.</p>
                <p> 3. Participants are encouraged, but not required, to start planning and developing the game after the official start of the Jam. They are, however, to learn the tools they will be using ahead of time.</p>
                <p> 4. Team efforts, as well as entries to the Game Jam from individuals, are accepted.</p>
                <p> 5. The games themselves should be as functional and complete as possible. Participants are allowed to deliver un­finished games, but will be penalized if they simply deliver concepts, artwork, or an unplayable game.</p>
                <p> 6. The games must run on a Windows or  GNU/Linux OS PC, either as stand­alone executables, browser games, or command­line text­based adventures. No mobile games are allowed due to platform limitations.</p>
                <p> 7. Any and all art­styles, genres, and mechanics are allowed as long as they are functional within the required platform.</p>
                <p> 8. The participants will submit the entry games to a GitHub or BitBucket public code repository, and shall include build instructions along with a stand­alone executable if they intend to work through that route. If the game is browser­-based, the player must provide a live version of their work at a publicly­available domain, whether hosted through Github Pages or another provider, in addition to their files in a public repository. </p>
                <p>9. In order to participate in the game jam, the developers must send an email to shacsgamejam@gmail.com that includes the URL to their public repository and their live version if applicable.</p>

                <p> For many of you this is the first time you make a game. If you don't know where to start, here are some great free tools.</p>

                <h3>Unity</h3>
                <p>Perhaps the most popular free game engine out there, Unity is a complete development suite for artists and programmers alike for 2D and 3D. It also has the biggest learning curve, and a lot of tutorials are misleading. Powerful, but requires a level 5 Code Monkey to use. Use responsibly.

                <h3>GameMaker Studio</h3>
                <p>A game engine for the complete beginner. No previous programming knowledge required. 2D only. The tutorials by YoYo Games are all you need to know what to do. It's quite limited in the range of things you can do with it. Don't think it's a mediocre tool: Hotline Miami is a GameMaker game.

                <h3>Contstruct 2</h3>
                <p>An alternative to GameMaker, Construct2 allows you to make and deploy games easily to the web browser. It allows for a wider breadth of concepts and plays nicely with most browsers. It implements a rudimentary event system to substitute a programming language. Quality tutorials for C2 are scarce.</p>

                <h3>Flixel</h3>
                <p>Powerful and fast, Flixel is a Flash Game Engine that excels at retro 2D graphics. Tutorials abound, but to get the full experience you need to dissect Adam Atomic's code examples. Note: You need Adobe Flash to work with it, as well as someone who has worked with ActionScript 3. Otherwise, use FlashDevelop with Apache Flex.</p>

                <h3>Phaser</h3>
                <p>Photon Storm's response to Flixel, Phaser is a Game Engine that stands above all other Javascript game engines for it's simplicity and power for browser games. Scalable, extensible, and versatile. In addition to Javascript, you can use Microsoft's super-set of the language: Typescript.</p>

                <h3>Godot</h3>
                <p>The Godot Game Engine is the little known Open Source response to the Unity Game Engine. It's still a bit rough around the edges, but if you learn how to use it, it packs quite a punch. It can do 3D as well as 2D game using a custom programming language. The only documentation worth reading is by the creators themselves.</p>

                <p>Can't draw? Can't program? Think you can trump those two with your storytelling skills? Inklewriter is a tool to create interactive, choose-your-own-adventure stories that used to be the bread and butter of games before pixels were invented. A simple, engaging interface is the perfect spot to create something unique. Be warned, your writing must be impecable.</p>

                <h3>LibGDX</h3>
                <p>For those inclined to work with Java, LibGDX is the best game engine available. A beefy beast that will require quite a bit of effort and patience to master, LibGDX is a veritable swiss-army knife of Game Engines that is able to deploy to multiple platforms, including mobile and web, with only one codebase. A monster worth taming.</p>

                <p>Think you are bad enough to tackle the big boy league? Are you so jaded and experienced that the prospect of a simple game is too boring? Unreal Engine is not free as-is, but if you register yourself with a .edu email address, UE4 and all of it's components are free for a year. This is the tool the professionals use. Be careful and good luck.</p>
